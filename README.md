# Shooter-Game
My first basic shooter game, written in Java.
I wrote this in Fall 2014 when I was first starting out with Java Programming.  With some help from Youtube tutorials and my Computer Science I class, I was able to create a pretty neat game.  While it took some time to get the basic foundation down, I really had a great time coming up with new ideas for powerups and enemies once I got going.
